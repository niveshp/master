Feature: DataSplit
	In order to split data
	As a Warewolf user
	I want a tool that splits two or more pieces of data

Scenario: Split text to a recordset using Index using Star notation
	Given A string to split with value "abcde"
	And  assign to variable "[[vowels(*).letters]]" split type "Index" at "1" and Include "unselected"

	Then the split result will be
	| vowels().letters |
