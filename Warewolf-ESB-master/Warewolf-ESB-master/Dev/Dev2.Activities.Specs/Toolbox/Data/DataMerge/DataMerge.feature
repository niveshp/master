Scenario Outline: Validation errors for all Invalid recordset indexes in datamerge 
	Given a merge variable '<Variable>' equal to "aA "
	And a merge variable "[[b]]" equal to "bB "	
	And an Input "<Variable>" and merge type "Index" and string at as "2" and Padding "" and Alignment "Left"
	And an Input "[[b]]" and merge type "Index" and string at as "2" and Padding "" and Alignment "Left"
	When the data merge tool is executed
	Then the merged result is ""
	And the execution has "AN" error
	And the debug inputs as  
	| # |                 | With  | Using | Pad | Align |
	| 1 | <Variable> = "" | Index | 2     | ""  | Left  |
	| 2 | [[b]] = bB      | Index | 2     | ""  | Left  |
	And the debug output as 
	| # |              |
	|   | [[result]] = |
