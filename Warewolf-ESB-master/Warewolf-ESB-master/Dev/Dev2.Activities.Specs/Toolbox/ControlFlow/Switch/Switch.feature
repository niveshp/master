Feature: Switch
	In order to branch based on the data
	As Warewolf user
	I want tool has multiple branching decisions based on the data

Scenario: Ensure that a variable evaluates to the value on the datalist
	Given I need to switch on variable "[[A]]" with the value "30"		
	When the switch tool is executed
	Then the variable "[[A]]" will evaluate to "30"
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug inputs as
	| Switch on   |
	| [[A]] =  30 |
	And the debug output as
	|    |
	| 30 |

Scenario: Ensure that a blank variable evaluates to blank
	Given I need to switch on variable "[[A]]" with the value ""		
	When the switch tool is executed
	Then the variable "[[A]]" will evaluate to ""
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug inputs as
	| Switch on |
	| [[A]] =   |
	And the debug output as
	|     |
	| " " |

Scenario: Ensure that a negative index throws an error	
	Given I need to switch on variable "[[rec(-1).val]]" with the value "Moses Mabida Stadium"		
	When the switch tool is executed	
	Then the execution has "AN" error
	And the debug inputs as
	| Switch on         |
	| [[rec(-1).val]] = |
	And the debug output as
	|  |
	|  |
