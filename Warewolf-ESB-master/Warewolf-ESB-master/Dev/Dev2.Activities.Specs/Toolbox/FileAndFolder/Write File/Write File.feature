Feature: Write File
	In order to be able to Write File
	as a Warewolf user
	I want a tool that writes a file at a given location

Scenario Outline: Write file at location
	Given I have a source path '<source>' with value '<sourceLocation>' 
	And source credentials as '<username>' and '<password>'	
	And Method is '<method>'
	And input contents as '<content>'     
	And result as '<resultVar>'
    When the write file tool is executed
	Then the result variable '<resultVar>' will be '<result>'
	And the execution has "<errorOccured>" error
	And the debug inputs as
         | Output Path                 | Method   | Username   | Password | File Contents |
         | <source> = <sourceLocation> | <method> | <username> | String   | <content>     |
	And the debug output as
		|                        |
		| <resultVar> = <result> |
		Examples: 
		| Name                     | source   | sourceLocation                                                  | method        | content        | username          | password | resultVar              | result  | errorOccured |

Scenario: Write file with carriage returns
	Given I have a source path '[[path]]' with value 'c:\filetowrite1.txt' 	
	And source credentials as '' and ''	
	And Method is 'Overwrite'
	And the input contents from a file 'infile1WithCarriageReturn.txt'     
	And result as 'Success'
    When the write file tool is executed	
	Then the output contents from a file 'outfile1WithCarriageReturn.txt'
	And the execution has "NO" error

Scenario: Write file when contents has variables that cannot be evealuated
	Given I have a source path '[[path]]' with value 'c:\filetowrite1.txt' 	
	And source credentials as '' and ''	
	And Method is 'Overwrite'
	And the input contents from a file 'filewithvariables.txt'     
	And result as '[[res]]'
	When the write file tool is executed	
	Then the result variable '[[res]]' will be ''
	And the execution has "AN" error
