Feature: Unique
	In order to find unique records in a recordset
	As a Warewolf user
	I want tool that will allow me 

Scenario: Find unique records in a recordset
	Given I have the following duplicated recordset
	| rs       | val |
	| rs().row | 10  |
	| rs().row | 20  |
	| rs().row | 20  |
	| rs().row | 30  |
	And I want to find unique in field "[[rs().row]]" with the return field "[[rs().row]]"
	And The result variable is "[[rec().unique]]"
	When the unique tool is executed	
	Then the unique result will be
	|               | unique |
	| rec().unique | 10     |
	| rec().unique | 20     |
	| rec().unique | 30     |
