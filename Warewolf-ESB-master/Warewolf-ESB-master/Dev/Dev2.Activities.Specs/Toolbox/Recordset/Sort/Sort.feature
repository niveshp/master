Feature: Sort
	In order to sort a recordset
	As a Warewolf user
	I want a tool I can use to arrange records in either ascending or descending order 

Scenario: Sort a recordset forwards using star notation
	Given I have the following recordset to sort
	| rs       | value    |
	| rs().row | You      |
	| rs().row | are      |
	| rs().row | the      |
	| rs().row | best     |
	| rs().row | Warewolf |
	| rs().row | user     |
	| rs().row | so far   |
	And I sort a record "[[rs(*).row]]"
	And my sort order is "Forward"
	When the sort records tool is executed
	Then the sorted recordset "[[rs().row]]"  will be 
	| rs       | value    |
	| rs().row | are      |
	| rs().row | best     |
	| rs().row | so far   |
	| rs().row | the      |
	| rs().row | user     |
	| rs().row | Warewolf |
	| rs().row | You      |
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug inputs as  
	| Sort Field               | Sort Order |
	| [[rs(1).row]] = You      |            |
	| [[rs(2).row]] = are      |            |
	| [[rs(3).row]] = the      |            |
	| [[rs(4).row]] = best     |            |
	| [[rs(5).row]] = Warewolf |            |
	| [[rs(6).row]] = user     |            |
	| [[rs(7).row]] = so far   | Forward    |
	And the debug output as
	|                          |
	| [[rs(1).row]] = are      |
	| [[rs(2).row]] = best     |
	| [[rs(3).row]] = so far   |
	| [[rs(4).row]] = the      |
	| [[rs(5).row]] = user     |
	| [[rs(6).row]] = Warewolf |
	| [[rs(7).row]] = You      |

Scenario: Sort a recordset backwards using star notation
	Given I have the following recordset to sort
	| rs       | value    |

	| rs().row | best     |
	| rs().row | Warewolf |
	| rs().row | user     |
	| rs().row | so far   |
	And I sort a record "[[rs(*).row]]"
	And my sort order is "Backwards"
	When the sort records tool is executed
	Then the sorted recordset "[[rs().row]]"  will be 
	| rs       | value    |
	| rs().row | You      |
	| rs().row | Warewolf |
	| rs().row | user     |
	| rs().row | the      |
	| rs().row | so far   |
	| rs().row | best     |
	| rs().row | are      |
	And the execution has "NO" error
	And the debug inputs as  
	| Sort Field               | Sort Order |
