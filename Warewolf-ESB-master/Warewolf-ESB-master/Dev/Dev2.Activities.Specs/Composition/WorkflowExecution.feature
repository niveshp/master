@WorkflowExecution
Feature: WorkflowExecution
	In order to execute a workflow on the server
	As a Warewolf user
	I want to be able to build workflows and execute them against the server

Background: Setup for workflow execution
			Given Debug events are reset
			And All environments disconnected
			And Debug states are cleared

Scenario: Simple workflow executing against the server
	 Given I have a workflow "WorkflowWithAssign"
	 And "WorkflowWithAssign" contains an Assign "Rec To Convert" as
	  | variable    | value |
	  | [[rec().a]] | yes   |
	  | [[rec().a]] | no    |	 
	  When "WorkflowWithAssign" is executed
	  Then the workflow execution has "NO" error
	  And the 'Rec To Convert' in WorkFlow 'WorkflowWithAssign' debug inputs as
	  | # | Variable      | New Value |
	  | 1 | [[rec().a]] = | yes       |
	  | 2 | [[rec().a]] = | no        |
	  And the 'Rec To Convert' in Workflow 'WorkflowWithAssign' debug outputs as

	  | [[rec().a]] | yes   |
	  | [[rec().a]] | no    |
	  And "WorkflowWithAssignAndCount" contains Count Record "CountRec" on "[[rec()]]" into "[[count]]"
	  When "WorkflowWithAssignAndCount" is executed
	  Then the workflow execution has "NO" error
	  And the 'Rec To Convert' in WorkFlow 'WorkflowWithAssignAndCount' debug inputs as
	  | # | Variable      | New Value |
	  | 1 | [[rec().a]] = | yes       |
	  | 2 | [[rec().a]] = | no        |

	 And "TestWFWithDBService" contains Count Record "Count" on "[[dbo_proc_SmallFetch()]]" into "[[count]]"
	  When "TestWFWithDBService" is executed
	  Then the workflow execution has "NO" error
	  And the 'Fetch' in WorkFlow 'TestWFWithDBService' debug inputs as
	  |  |
	  |  |
	  And the 'Fetch' in Workflow 'TestWFWithDBService' debug outputs as
